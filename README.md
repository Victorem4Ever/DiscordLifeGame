... THIS GAME IS IN DEVELOPMENT ...

-----------------------------------
-----------------------------------

HOW TO INSTALL :

1. Install python (not necessary the latest because it can cause bugs, I'm actually on python 3.9.5).
    Website : https://www.python.org/downloads/
    

-----------------------------------
-----------------------------------

THERE ARE 2 WAYS TO PLAY :

1. Install git :
    Website : https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git
    
    After installing git you can clone the repository :
        git clone https://github.com/Victorem4Ever/DiscordLifeGame
        (in a shell)


2. Download the zip file of the repository

Then, go to the folder who was created :
    cd DiscordLifeGame
    (in the same shell)
    Next, you have to install the dependances :
        python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
        Now you can play to the game by launching the main.py file :
        python3 main.py
        (in the good directory, or just double click on the file)
        
I recommend you to make a shortcut of the main.py file.
Enjoy ~~and fly safe~~ :)
